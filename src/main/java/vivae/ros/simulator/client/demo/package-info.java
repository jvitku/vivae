 * These classes are for testing SimulatorControls servers by hand.

 * E.g. basic.AsynchronousClient requests from the SimulatorServer simulation with given map after
 * pressing any key.
 * 
 * Asynchronous requesting over the ROS network did not prove to be good idea, 
 * so SynchornousService class was implemented and MySynchrnousRequester tests this..
